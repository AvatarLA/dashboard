# serverless-dashboard

React and Redux based Dashboard for Serverless

## Running the project

The generated project includes a development server on port `3000`, which will rebuild the app whenever you change application code. To start the server (with the dev-tools enabled), run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

To run the server with the devtools disabled, run:

```bash
$ DEBUG=false npm start
```

To build for production, this command will output optimized production code:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
